# Tandem Code Challenge 

## Goal

The goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple-choice answers to select
from. 
In this challege, the player can view the question(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command-line-tool, etc. There is no specific language requirement, so any framework or language is acceptable.
This README includes information about how to run the code, any known issues or complexities, and any additional features you that could have enhanced the trivia application.

## Acceptance Criteria

• A user can view questions.
• Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
• Questions should not repeat in a round.
• A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
• The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer.
• A user can see the score they received at the end of the round.
